# Dual-Controller
This project implements a dual controller system for a pair of elevators working at the same time.
The elevator works on the basis of priority. When a user at a certain floor pushes a button the nearest elevator will come to serve the user. 
The language used to implement the controller was System Verilog and it is implemented onto an FPGA. The project was built to the Digital Design Course @Bilkent University. 
The project got full points and here is a picture before the project presentation demo.
